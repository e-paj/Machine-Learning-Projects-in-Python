# Medical-Insurance-ML-Project 🏥

❓
**Problem**: What is the medical insurance cost an insurance company will incur each patient/insurer?

💡
**Objective**:  Build a ML model that can predict the medical insurance cost using the data given by the insurance company.

📅
**Date**: Oct. 04 - 08

📝
**Workflow**:
 - Need insurance cost data: contains attributes like gender and health issues of the patient.
 - Anlayze the data: plot somee graphs to see the relationships of the attributes
 - Data pre-processing
 - Split Train-Test Data: will be used to evaluate the performance of the model
 - Linear Regression Model
 - Trained Linear Regression Model: a model where we will feed new data to get prediction of insruance cost
